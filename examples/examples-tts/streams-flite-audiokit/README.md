# Using FLITE Speach to Text

I am providing a simple sketch which generates sound data with the Flite text to speach engine.
You need to install https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-flite

The output goes to a ‘AI Thinker Audio Kit’.

### Dependencies

You need to install the following libraries:

- [Arduino Audio Tools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools)
- [Audio Driver](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-driver)
- [FLITE](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-flite)

FLITE is quite big: you need to need to use the custom Partition Schema or RainMaker 4MB no OTA
