## Using the AI Thinker ESP32 Audio Kit as SD Player

I found some cheap [AI Thinker ESP32 Audio Kit V2.2](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/en/esp32-audio-kit) on AliExpress and because I was tired of all the wires I had to connect to implement my different scenarios that are possible with my [Arduino Audio Tools Library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools), I thought it to be a good idea to buy this board.
