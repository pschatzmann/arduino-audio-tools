// This example shows how you can create a basic counter with a phasor.
// A phasor oscillator can create a ramp between any two values.
// It takes three inputs - frequency, start value and stop value.
// These are all double precision floats, so it's a continuous slide.
// If you write it into an integer, it will round it off for you.
// This creates a bunch of steps.

    // It happens automagically in these cases.
    
    // Once every second, CurrentCount counts from 1 until it gets to 9, then resets itself.
    // When it reaches 9 it resets, so the values you get are 1-8.
