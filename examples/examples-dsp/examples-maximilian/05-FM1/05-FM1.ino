// One way of thinking about FM synthesis is to see it as vibrato.
// You make a pitch, then vary it up and down at some rate.
// You can change the speed of the pitch variation (modulation frequency), and also the amount of variation (modulation index).
// In FM, usually only one of the waveforms - the carrier that provides the initial pitch - is sent to the output.
// The frequency of the the carrier wave is continually adjusted at a rate equal to the frequency of the second wave (the modulator).
// So at any given point in time, the frequency of the carrier can increase by an amount equal to the current amp of the modulator.
// This has some interesting effects.

    // Perhaps you should comment out the above line and uncomment the below one instead
    // It shows how the frequency of the carrier is altered by ADDING a second waveform to its frequency value.
    // The carrier frequency is 440, and the modulation frequency is 1.
    // It also shows how the modulation index works. In this case the modulation index is 100
    // Try adjusting the modolation index. Also, try altering the modulation frequency.
