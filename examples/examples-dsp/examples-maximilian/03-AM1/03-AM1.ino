    // The waves aren't 'beating'. Instead, the amplitude of one is modulating the amplitude of the other
    // Remember that the sine wave has positive and negative sections as it oscillates.
    // When you multiply something by -1, its phase is inverted but it retains its amplitude.
    // So you hear 2 waves per second, not 1, even though the frequency is 1.
